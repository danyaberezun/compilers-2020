-- Expression evaluator

import List;
import State;


-- The evaluator itself: takes a state and an expression,
-- returns integer value
--
-- An expression is represented by a data structure of the following shape:
--
-- expr = Var   (string)             |
--        Const (int)                |
--        Binop (string, expr, expr)
